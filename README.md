# OrbitalBrowser
A browser still in the making but fully usable for everyone. OrbitalBrowser is the basic of all browser software, with no minimal requirements because there is no sneaky files running in the background.
We want to make the best browser out there so give us your ideas on https://www.reddit.com/r/FlipSideMediaForums and leave good and bad feedback about our software.
V1.4 is the latest, ONLY AVALIBLE FOR WINDOWS 7, 8 AND 10
